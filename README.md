# Snake
A short project aimed at recreating the cult game called *"Snake"* in a climate similar to 8-bit.
The main goal of the project was to get to know the *Pygame* library and learn object-oriented programming.

# Libraries:
- *Pygame* - game engine (2.0.1),
- *NumPy* - 8-bit object surfaces (1.21.2),
- *Pyinstaller* - convert program to executive file (4.5.1),
- other built-in libraries, such as: *os*, *math*, *copy*.
